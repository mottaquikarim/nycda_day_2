All your relevant code should go inside this folder.\n* It should have **one** html file only (**QUESTION**: what should that file be called...?)\n* Your HTML file can be simple, just a **\"Hello, Wrold\"** should suffice (use the **h1** tag).\n* Remember to use proper HTML formatting. What tags must you have in **all** HTML files? Include them.\n* Deploy your site to the internet with GitHub.\n\n**REMINDER**\n\n* Here is how you **[deploy a sample page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfBOrn3IzLw)** to the internet.\n\n\n#### Task 2: Simple Markup\n---\n\nCreate a valid HTML page and add the proper markup so that it appears **similar** to this:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mottaquikarim/nycda_day_2/blob/master/nytimes_screenshot.png?raw=true\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://github.com/mottaquikarim/nycda_day_2/blob/master/nytimes_screenshot.png?raw=true\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\"></a>\n\n**REQUIREMENTS**\n\n* Note that we require your version to look **similar**, not exactly the same. \n * In general, do not worry about getting the fonts, borders, spacings correct. We will learn about that eventually.\n * Focus specifically on getting the **tags** correct. For example, what tag would you need for the title of the article? How about for the content? Etc\n* Deploy your page to GitHub just like you did in Task 1.\n\n\n\n\n","idx":3},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup"]}
